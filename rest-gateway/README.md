# gRPC gateway 

This gets generated by running the following from within the `sdk/src/main/proto` directory

```bash
buf mod update && buf generate
mv domfin/sdk/services rest-gateway/srv
rm -rf domfin/sdk
```

Assuming we have a gRPC service running on localhost:9999, we should now be able to run the generated gateway from this directory with:

```bash
go run main/main.go
```

Then, we can hit a gRPC endpoint by issuing a simple POST request via CURL:

```bash
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"categorisation_filter": "ALL"}' http://localhost:8081/domfin.sdk.services.TransactionService/GetCategorisedExpenses
```
